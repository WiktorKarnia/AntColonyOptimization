# Ant Colony Optimization (ACO)

This project implements the **Ant Colony Optimization (ACO)** algorithm, which is a nature-inspired optimization technique based on the behavior of ants searching for food. The algorithm is often applied to solve combinatorial optimization problems, such as the **Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP)**, **Vehicle Routing Problem (VRP)**, and other pathfinding and optimization problems.

## Features

- **Ant Colony Optimization**: The implementation is based on a popular metaheuristic algorithm inspired by real ants' behavior to find the best results for a limited load Vechicle Routing Problem.
- **Visualization**: The algorithmâ€™s progress and results can be visualized to better understand how ants explore and find solutions.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/WiktorKarnia/AntColonyOptimization.git
   cd AntColonyOptimization
   ```

2. Create and activate a virtual environment:
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

3. Install the required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install matplotlib
   ```

## Usage

To run the algorithm, follow the instructions below:

  ```bash
   python ACOsimulator.py 
   ```
